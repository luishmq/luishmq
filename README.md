### Rossmann Pharmacy Network Sales Forecast:
Data science project developed with Machine Learning algorithms in order to predict the sales value of Rossmann pharmacies for the next 6 weeks. It was developed using the Python language, algorithms such as Random Forest and XGBoost and the practical visualization takes place through a Bot created in the Telegram application. The adopted model predicted a baseline scenario with consolidated gross revenue of â‚¬281.1M for the next 6 weeks. In the worst case, consolidated gross revenues will be â‚¬280.1M, and in the best case, â‚¬282M.

### Churn Forecast of Customers of TopBank Banking Company: 
Data science project developed with Machine Learning algorithms in order to predict the churn of customers of a banking company and develop strategies to avoid the phenomenon. It was developed using the Python language, algorithms such as Random Forest Classifier and XGBoost Classifier. The adopted model resulted in excellent performances in metrics such as the F1_score ( 91%) and provided the formulation of an action plan to solve the churning problem based on sending discount coupons to customers according to their churn probability and the ROI (Return on Investment) maximization. At the end of the project, the ROI reached, as a gross amount, approximately $489070.00, which represents an ROI of 4891%.

### Development of a Management Dashboard for a Restaurant Marketplace with Streamlit: 
In this project, the concepts of python programming, data manipulation, strategic thinking and business logic, along with web development tools such as Streamlit and Github, were used to develop a management panel with the main metrics of a marketplace company food. The end result of the project was a panel hosted in a Cloud environment that assists the CEO in possible decision-making through insights generated from the analysis. The project is available through a link. The dashboard can be accessed from any device connected to the internet.
